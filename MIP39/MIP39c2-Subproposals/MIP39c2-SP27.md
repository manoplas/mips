## Sentence Summary

MIP39c2-SP27 adds Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent.

## Paragraph Summary

Maker Talent goal is focused on recruiting best-in-class talent for the Maker Protocol, targeted through innovative social recruiting practices and offering an amazing candidate experience. Maker Talent has been incubated by SES since September 2021.

## Specification

### Motivation.

#### The Problem.

As MakerDAO and its Core Unit grow, the need of connecting with professionals in the Blockchain industry becomes a critical matter that requires both urgent attention and a long term strategy.

Until now, Core Units have been growing by employing their own resources and personal network to find required talent, but this strategy is limited as MakerDAO scales up. 

By observing the upcoming challenges for Maker in growth and adoption, and the struggle for finding talent within such a small niche, the lack of a recruitment strategy can compromise the success of MakerDAO.

We believe that a long term solution to this problem will be developing and maintaining an active pool of blockchain professionals, that are enthusiastic about the Maker spirit and projects, so we can speed up and facilitate the process of onboarding them when needed.

#### Our Values

## Strategy

Our primary strategy consists of four pillars that break down Maker Talent's mission into actionable early stage roadmaps. To grow as a reliable partner for Maker DAO hiring needs, we need to parallelize activities across these pillars. To reiterate, we must:

1.  Gain reliability from hiring partners within Maker DAO
2.  Find the best talent across the blockchain world
3.  Utilize Social Recruiting as main recruitment strategy
4.  Provide amazing candidate experience

Let's dive a bit deeper into the strategies mentioned. Here is how we are going to make these actionable. These activities are showing a strategy that has already been put in place since the incubation program started (and we recruited 9 professionals). We are now working on another 8-10 openings for 2022.

### Gain reliability from hiring partners within Maker DAO

The hiring market is a double-sided market. Providing great candidate experience is just one side of a coin. The other side though, puts a requirement on us to be seen by the hiring parties (Core Unit Hiring Managers) as _the_  MakerDAO Hiring Agency. 

* Build a network of Subject Matter Experts to help filter and recruit best-in-class talent
* Create a central hub for all MakerDAO's hiring needs, easily approachable by both hiring managers and candidates
* Act as a partner that understands the Core Unit needs and roadmap
* Deliver candidates that match requirements  within a reasonable timeframe
* Provide continuous insights about market status and candidate's funnel
* Create an easy-to-follow, automated and online registered process to request new hires

### Utilize Social Recruiting as main recruitment strategy

Blockchain talent - experts and developers alike are often prominent within social networks on and off-line. We need to make sure to seek them out with both inbound and outbound strategies. 

* Set up easily identifiable branding for Maker Talent that promotes MakerDAO at the same time
* Create recruiting strategies for Twitter, Github, Stack Overflow and others
* Offer cristal clear and fair referral program to increase talent pull effect by MakerDAO itself
* Deliver workshops and keynotes around a variety of hiring and retention topics
* Sponsor and attend industry events attracting young yet undiscovered talents

### Provide amazing candidate experience

As talent is scarsce within the crypto space, we need to make sure we provide an experience that is both fair, involving and transparent to the potential candidate. Regardless of final decision, candidates should regard time spent in recruitment process as valuable, contributing to their individual growth. 

* Act as a partner with candidates to assist them in the preparation of their interviews by explaining the process in detail and aligning expectations at all stages
* Train interviewers (hiring managers and recruiters) on interviewing skills
* Optimise and promote our software to track candidates (Applicant Tracking System or ATS) as an easy-to-use tool for hiring by training interviewers  with insightful and useful videos and workshops
* Compensate candidates for doing complex tech tests
* Prepare a set of communication materials to guarantee that candidates are properly informed about the position, conditions, MakerDAO projects and our roadmap
* Constantly improve performance of recruiters, hiring managers and everyone involved in the process by sharing qualitative feedback and KPIs from candidate surveys.
* Make sure that effective and personalised feedback is sent to all rejected candidates.
* Assist and guide interviewers at all times so they can be better prepared when facing interviews.

### Find the best talent in the blockchain world

* Invest in apps and tools to reach the best developers within their communities.
* Attract top candidates by creating a process that is fun, insightful and enriching.
* Train recruiters so they can acquire the needed expertise in terms of social recruiting, sourcing and MakerDAO business domain. 
* Create a clear and easy process for candidates to apply for future opportunities: backed up by a team focused on nurturing our talent pool, doing proactive interviews and assisting to fairs and blockchain events.
* Keep in touch and interact with our existing database of professionals so we can get the most out our existing database.

## Challenges we will face
Let's consider a few real-world scenarios that can most likely pose a challenge for our endeavors and as such needs to be quickly mitigated.

#### Talent scarcity
Blockchain talent is scarce. In addition to the basic hard skills, candidates need to outperform others in the new decentralised, distributed environment. How do we make sure we reach them and how?

##### Answer

Blockchain talent is pretty unusual. You don't post an offer and people start appling like in other industries, also in most of the times it is hard to know the candidate's real name and collect efficiently their deliveries accross social media. 

It is necessary to connect with them through common interests and promote inbound recruitment. Some examples include events, webinars, sharing common practices, participating in meet-ups and stay in touch not only when you need them. The use of our community power is key: we need to transform every Maker stakeholder into a connection to the best talent.

#### Sub-par candidate quality

How do we make sure that we ask the right questions to assess candidate's competence in an industry where everything changes so fast?

##### Answer

During interviews we tend to be much too focused on what candidates answer. We are used to classic questions-vs-answer interviews: here the outcome ends up being limited. Candidates tend to reply always the same type of answers to stay at the safe zone and reduce the risk of confrontation.

We need to create complex but realistic problems that are similar to the scenarios that Maker faces every day. We also need to promote the candidate-interviewer interaction by asking more open and insightful questions. During an interview, the process can teach much more than the final answer. 

Giving acurate and on-the-moment feedback, engaging by co-creating new solutions and inspiring them with Maker's vision and mindset is part of the esencial skillset to get the most out of interviews and guarantee a nice recruiting experience.

#### Measuring Performance the right way
A usual metric for recruitment agencies in the centralised world is the moment of "hire" . That puts quantity over quality. This simplistic strategy often disregards if and how long successful hire stays at the position.  Funds spent on the hiring process are thus easily wasted by short retention period and both time and resources needed to phase in a new candidate into their new position.

##### Answer

Creating a scalable and efficient recruitment machine for Maker might sometimes require the employment of recruitment agencies, but we will try to avoid it as much as possible for cost and quality reasons. Partnering with hiring managers with well-trained internal HR professionals is key to achieve this. The more engaged we keep our community with Maker's vision and projects, the less help we will need from externals.
