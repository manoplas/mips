## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP#1: adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent

## Paragraph Summary

The Maker Talent CU budget is designed with the following goals in mind:

- To pay the DAI compensation to Core Unit members;
- To sponsor events where Maker Talent will meet potential candidates;
- To pay a part of the referral bonus as an incentive;
- To pay the operational costs of the CU (e.g candidates management software, gas fees and job advertisements);
- To mantain a reasonable buffer for unexpected expenses (legal, financial and other).

Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders will commit to:

- Funding a 3-month runway for MT-001;
- Replenish the budget on a quarterly basis;
- Including members of the Core Unit in the SES MKR Incentive Plan. For more details see **MIP40c3: Modify Core Unit Budget (MKR) - Maker Talent (MT-001).**
