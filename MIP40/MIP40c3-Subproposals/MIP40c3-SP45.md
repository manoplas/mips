## Sentence Summary

MIP40c3-SP#1: adds the DAI budget for the Core Unit MT-001: Maker Talent

## Paragraph Summary

The Maker Talent CU budget is designed with the following goals in mind:

- To pay the DAI compensation to Core Unit members;
- To sponsor events where Maker Talent will meet potential candidates;
- To pay a part of the referral bonus as an incentive;
- To pay the operational costs of the CU (e.g candidates management software, gas fees and job advertisements);
- To mantain a reasonable buffer for unexpected expenses (legal, financial and other).

Therefore, a vote to ratify this MIP means MKR holders will commit to:

- Funding a 3-month runway for MT-001;
- Replenish the budget on a quarterly basis;
- Including members of the Core Unit in the SES MKR Incentive Plan. For more details see **MIP40c3: Modify Core Unit Budget (MKR) - Maker Talent (MT-001).**

## Specification

### Motivation

Going by the critical nature of the work done by the Maker Talent Core Unit, sufficient funds need to be provisioned in order to guarantee the success of the Maker ecosystem in the long run.

### Core Unit ID

- MT-001

### List of Budget Implementations

Nearly 30% of this budget is allocated to variable expenses that are impacted by the demand of profiles (i.e., the more openings we have, the greater the budget that will be spent on posting offers, expanding our team of recruiters and even paying more referral bonuses).

On a quarterly basis, the budget is composed of:
